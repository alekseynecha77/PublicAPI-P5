# PublicAPI-P5
 


This is a browser app for a fiction company called Awesome Startup with employees working remotely over the US. With this app, the employees have a way to share contact info with each other.

It is uses JavaScript to grab information for 12 random "employees" from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)

A JSON object is requested from the API for 12 employees which are then listed in a grid on the browser with their image, name, email, and location.

Clicking the employee gives you more information on the employee including their birthday and address.

For exceed expectation grade, I adeed search functionality and svg icon near the input field. This way the user can click on svg, and it will immediately give focus on search field, so you can search employee right away.

I changed a few things about the styling of the app from its standard look, they include:

The background color
Font
Borders
